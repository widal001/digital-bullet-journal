# Apache Spark

## Description

Apache Spark is an open source analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It is commonly used alongside Hadoop Distributed File Storage ([[tools/hdfs]]) and is a common substitute for [[map-reduce]]. It supports a number of languages including:

- [[scala]]
- [[java]]
- [[python]]
- [[r]]

## Troubleshooting

- [zsh: no matches found: local[4]](https://zpjiang.me/2015/10/17/zsh-no-match-found-local-spark/) - This error occurs when trying to run `pyspark --master local[4]` to run a local spark cluster with 4 workers. The solution is to surround `"local[4]"` with quotes and the rationale is explained in the article linked above. It has to do with the differences in bash and zsh syntax.
- [Exception: Java gateway process exited before sending the driver its port number](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67029299/7338319) - This error occurred when trying to run `pyspark` from the command line because the `$JAVA_HOME` version wasn't set correctly. The resolution was to use `jenv local <JAVA_VERSION>` to set the preferred java version for the project.
