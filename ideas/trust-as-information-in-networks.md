- Traditional models of sequential prisoners dilemma lack important features that are present in real-life networks:
  - Players often have some ability to influence which opponents they play.
  - Players may face multiple opponents between repeated rounds with given opponent.
  - Players do not have an unlimited memory to record the previous behavior of every opponent they've faced.
  - Players can often use signals or traits from their opponent to develop expectations about their opponent's strategy.

Even without history of prior matches, actors often form expectations about an opponent based on the signals that they share with other opponents.
